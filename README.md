Deepens my skill to write clean code.

Assignment: Clean code refactor
Your friend Victor has done some kind of game in Python but he did it in a somewhat ugly way (no offense, Victor only started coding a couple of weeks ago).

But you know how important clean code is, so it's your chance to help him to make his code more readable and maintainable!


What are you supposed to do?
1. Open the classroom assignment from here.
2. Read the program line by line and try to understand it (you may also want to read it aloud to practice technical language :) )!
3. Run the program and check whether your understanding was correct!
4. Then refactor your code according to the clean code principles. Commit code after each steps. (Running code with same output as original, obviously. :))


Rules you decided to follow
1. Always keep the features of the original code (don't even change a dot or newline).
2. Always keep the code in a runnable state.
3. Commit early commit often.
4. Pay attention to create not only readable but maintainable code as well.

This exercise deepens your skill to write clean code.
